- What a Large Language Model (LLM) is
- LLM Models Naming; ie. id format --- Organization/Model name, eg

- Difference between system, user, and assistant prompts

## What I Tried

## Key Takeaways
-  Different models perfom different tasks, we can have models that support coding, texty based or video - based  suppport, it all depends on which model you want to choose
